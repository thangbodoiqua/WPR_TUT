Question 1: What is the order of statements logged to the console? 
Answer:
1. '1' is logged first when the function `orderExecutor` is executed.
2. Then, '3' is logged immediately because the `setTimeout` in the promise is asynchronous.
3. After 1 second, the promise is resolved and '2' is logged.

Order: '1', '3', '2'.

Question 2: What happens if the button is not clicked within 5 seconds?
Answer:
If the button is not clicked within 5 seconds, the `reject` function is called by `setTimeout`. As a result, the `.catch()` block is executed, and 'Option B' is logged to the console.

Question 3: What happens if this button is clicked after 5 seconds?
Answer:
If the button is clicked after 5 seconds, nothing happens. Once the promise is either resolved or rejected, it is settled and cannot be changed. Since the promise is rejected by `setTimeout` after 5 seconds, 'Option B' is logged to the console and even if the button is clicked after that, the event handler executes the `resolve` but doesn't affect the already settled promise.

Question 4: What value is logged to the console?
Answer:
1. The promise is resolved with the value `1`.
2. In the first `.then()`, the `add` function adds 5 to 1, returning `6`.
3. In the second `.then()`, the `multiply` function multiplies 6 by 6, returning `36`.
4. `console.log` logs `36`.

Value logged: 36.

Question 5: What value is logged to the console?
Answer:
1. The promise is resolved with the value `1`.
2. The `add` function returns a new promise, which resolves with `1 + 5 = 6`.
3. The second `.then()` receives `6` and logs it to the console.

Value logged: 6.

Question 6: What is the order of statements logged to the console?
Answer:
1. '1' is logged immediately when `orderExecutor` is executed.
2. Then, the promise is resolved with the value '2', so '2' is logged inside `.then()`.
3. Finally, '3' is logged right after the promise is created.

Order: '1', '3', '2'.
